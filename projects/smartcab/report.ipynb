    "Green light -> None (1/5)\n",
    "3/10 possibilities at a random light will keep the car stopped. That's definitely smaller than what I observe. There must be something about the orientation of the lights that means the probability of hitting a red light vs. green light is not equal (when you see a red, you see it for many turns, while you pass through a green quickly). That means the algorithm will maybe make right-turns at red lights to get out of them.\n",
